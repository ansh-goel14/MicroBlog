# microblog
The idea and the UI is based on Udemy's Course [Web-dev with Flask and python](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-developer-bootcamp-flask-python/).
However, multiple changes have been made keeping the core idea of the blogging site the same. I have added a user login feature, added dynamic blog adding  and deletion and much more.
